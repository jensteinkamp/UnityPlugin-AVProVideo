I was wondering if you have any advise on how to play video on various platforms and browsers with WebGL?
Do you think Chrome will ever work?

AVPro Video (Windows) 1.10.2 Unity asset
Unity 2019.3.7f1
Microsoft Surface Laptop Windows 10 Pro
Mac browsers Safari works by changing settings, Firefox does not work, Chrome does not work
PC browsers Edge works, Firefox sometimes works, Chrome 81.0.4044.92 does not work
